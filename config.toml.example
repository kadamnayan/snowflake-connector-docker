# Snowflake Connection Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: This is a template file with dummy values.
# Replace with your actual Snowflake account credentials.
# 
# To get your account identifier:
# 1. Log into your Snowflake web interface
# 2. Look at the URL: https://<account_identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com
# 3. The account identifier is the part before .snowflakecomputing.com
#
# Example: If your URL is https://abc123.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com
# Then your account identifier is: abc123.us-east-1

[connections.my_example_connection]
# Your Snowflake account identifier (replace with actual value)
account = "abc123.us-east-1"

# Your Snowflake username (replace with actual value)
user = "your_username"

# Your Snowflake password (replace with actual value)
password = "your_secure_password"

# Your Snowflake role (common roles: ACCOUNTADMIN, SYSADMIN, USERADMIN, SECURITYADMIN)
role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"

# Your Snowflake warehouse (default is usually COMPUTE_WH)
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"

# Your Snowflake database (you may need to create one if it doesn't exist)
database = "TESTDB"

# Your Snowflake schema (PUBLIC is the default schema)
schema = "PUBLIC"

# Optional: Additional connection parameters
# timeout = 120
# login_timeout = 60
# network_timeout = 60

# Example of a complete working configuration (replace with your values):
# [connections.my_example_connection]
# account = "xy12345.us-central1.gcp"
# user = "testuser"
# password = "MySecurePassword123!"
# role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
# warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
# database = "TESTDB"
# schema = "PUBLIC"
